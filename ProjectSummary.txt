Project Summary 
We are launching a single-page, high-end landing site that showcases the 
NeonCube product line and collects pre-orders. 
The site must be: 
● Visually premium (chrome, blue neon seams, black background). 
● Mobile-optimized and fast-loading. 
● Fully functional with pre-order form submissions working from day one. 
Site Structure 
1. 
Hero – Product image, headline, subtext, CTA (“Choose your NeonCube”). 
2. Models – 3 product cards (S, M, X) with specs, VAT-inclusive pricing, 
“Pre-order” button. 
3. Gallery – Close-up visuals and craftsmanship story. 
4. Specs – Materials, thermals, connectivity. 
5. Testimonial – One quote for trust. 
6. FAQ – 3 key answers. 
7. Lead Capture Modal – Opens from any pre-order button, fields: 
○ Name 
○ Email 
○ Phone (optional) 
○ Delivery city 
○ Hidden model field (pre-filled) 
8. Mobile Sticky CTA – Always shows selected model + pre-order button. 
9. Footer – Copyright. 

Tech & Tools 
● Framework: React + Tailwind CSS (code already available). 
● Hosting: Vercel (free). 
● Version Control: GitHub. 
● Form Handling: Formspree (free tier). 
● Domain: Namecheap or Porkbun. 
● Analytics: Google Analytics or Plausible (optional). 
Your Step-by-Step Tasks 
Day 1 – Setup 
1. 
Create a GitHub repo neoncube-site. 
2. Push the existing code into it. 
3. Connect the repo to Vercel and set up: 
○ main branch → production. 
○ Automatic deploys. 
4. Buy domain (Namecheap/Porkbun) → connect DNS to Vercel (SSL 
auto-provisioned). 
Day 2–3 – Build 
1. 
Replace INLINE_IMG with full base64 hero/gallery image or host on 
Cloudinary. 
2. Finalize content (specs, prices, VAT label, copy). 
3. Style to match premium/luxury aesthetic. 
4. Ensure responsive design on mobile & desktop. 
5. Make sure sticky mobile CTA works. 
 
Day 4 – Integrate Form 
1. 
Create a free Formspree account. 
2. Get endpoint URL and replace form submit handler in modal: 
fetch("https://formspree.io/f/XXXXXXX", { 
method: "POST", 
body: new FormData(formElement) 
}) 
.then(() => alert("Thanks! We'll reach out within 24 hours.")) 
.catch(() => alert("Submission failed. Please email us instead.")); 
3. Test submission → confirm email notification received. 
Day 5 – QA & Launch 
1. 
Test on Chrome, Safari, Firefox, mobile browsers. 
2. Check all links, buttons, images, and forms. 
3. Check load speed (Lighthouse or GTmetrix). 
4. Merge to main → Vercel auto-deploys live site. 
Cost 
● Hosting: $0 (Vercel free). 
● Formspree: $0 (free tier). 

● Domain: ~$12/year. 
Deliverable: 
A live, fully functional NeonCube landing page on the custom domain, ready for 
ads and pre-orders. 
Once complete, send me: 
● Live URL 
● Form submission test result 
● GitHub repo link 
Let me know if you have any blockers — but the expectation is one week from 
start to full launch.
